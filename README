A Google Chrome extension that shows the current URL as a QR code.

I often use this to quickly copy a URL to my smartphone.

It uses Kazuhiko Arases javascript library (http://www.d-project.com/) to
draw the QR codes instead of relying on some third-party web API (like
all of the other extensions I looked at. Wtf?).

Installing:
    You can install this Chrome extension from Chrome Web Store.
